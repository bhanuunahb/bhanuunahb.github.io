                    <p>This is a great course for someone stepping into the field of machine learning with no prior knowledge in statistics or artificial intelligence. Andrew Ng provides a step by step approach into the basics of machine learning along with quizes and assignments in MATLAB/OCTAVE. While learning the concepts theoritically you can apply them to real word scenarios by the data sets provided by them. This course however, does not provide insights to any particular area of machine learning.

                    <p>This is a great comprehensive book for someone venturing into the field of AI best first textbook to read. It familiarizes the reader with the various aspects of AI like data mining, etc. However if you are looking for specialized information, this is not the book to go for. It does not assume any prior knowledge in the field of AI/maths(minimal) and thus is a great book to begin with written in very simple language. Having a good programming background on data structures /graph theory would be a plus.

                    <p>With the scarcity of books on deep learning in the market this one definitely ranks amongst the best that I have read on neural networks. In spite of coming across neural networks several times I was never really able to grasp its foundation to an optimum level. This book starts from scratch with neural networks to develop a network to identify hand written digits. It covers not only the theoretical aspect of the neural networks along with derivation and explanation of how the formulas were generated but also includes how these techniques are used in the world today and what are the latest advacnes made in this field.

                    <p>Do you wish to develop your very own customized recommendation engine ? An excellent book to give one the nudge required to put into implementation after one has read all the theory behind but failed to implement a real time implementation and get started with recommendation engines hands on. Its step by step clear approach leaves no room for ambiguity and helps one to get going without assuming any prior knowledge in the field of machine learning. Although (neural networks) it doesn’t explain the in depth analysis and the proofs of the theorems it’s the one to pick if youa re familiar with the theory but not exactly sure how to implement it. However don’t take this book as standalone savior , it would be good if one made oneself familiar with the theory wthout relying on it. Moreover it gives python code implementation of the concepts as a part of it so even if you are used to code in some other language you wont have to spend time familiarizing with basics of python for implementation You can jump straight ahead. Doesn’t provide strong foundation with the concepts of machine learning. Just how to build them.
